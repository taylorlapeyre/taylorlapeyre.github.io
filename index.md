I'm a **software engineer** in San Francisco, CA that loves to build complex systems in simple ways.

I'm working at [Everlane][everlane], one of my favorite clothing brands. Over the years, I have been a contractor, intern, and recently a full time employee for them. These days I help build experiments, products, and features for growing Everlane online.

I recently achieved a degree in Computer Science from Louisiana State University.

During my time at LSU, I worked closely with the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][lbrn]. I rebuilt and redesigned their website from scratch. I was also a lead developer at a startup called Spare Hanger for almost two years. While there, I implemented and designed many features of their website and lead a team of two other developers.

Take a look at my [collection of personal projects][projects] or follow me on [Twitter][twitter]. Need to get in touch quickly? [email][email] your best bet. Still reading? A little more [about me][about].
