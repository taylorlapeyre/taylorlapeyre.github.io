I'm a web developer studying at Louisiana State University.

I'm currently interning at [Everlane][everlane] in San Francisco, where I am lucky enough to be working for one of my favorite clothing brands.

I was a lead developer at [Spare Hanger][sh] for almost two years, where I implemented and designed many features of the site.

I've also built the website for the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][lbrn] and worked closely with them at LSU for three years.

This year I made a new [website][agora] that will make it easier for people to find new ways to code.

I love to talk about software, programming, design, music, and many other things. You can reach me through [Twitter][twitter] or [email][email].

Still reading? A little more [about me][about].
