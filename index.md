I'm a programmer studying at Louisiana State University.

I recently interned at [Everlane][everlane] in San Francisco, where I was lucky enough to work for one of my favorite clothing brands.

I was also a lead developer at a startup called Spare Hanger for almost two years. While there, I implemented and designed many features of the website.

At LSU, I've worked closely with the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][lbrn] for three years. During that time, I rebuilt and redesigned their website from scratch.

I have a treasured [collection of personal projects][projects] that I've built over the years.

I love to talk about software, clothing, design, music, and many other things. You can reach me through [Twitter][twitter] or [email][email].

Still reading? A little more [about me][about].
