I'm a web developer studying at Louisiana State University.

Recently, I interned at [Everlane][everlane] in San Francisco, where I was lucky enough to work for one of my favorite clothing brands.

I was a also lead developer at Spare Hanger for almost two years. While there, I implemented and designed many features of the site.

I've worked closely with the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][lbrn] at LSU for three years. During that time, I rebuilt and redesigned their website from scratch.

This year I made a [couple][koan] new [websites][agora] as personal projects to challenge myself.

I love to talk about software, clothing, design, music, and many other things. You can reach me through [Twitter][twitter] or [email][email].

Still reading? A little more [about me][about].
