I'm a programmer that is building the technology behind [Everlane][everlane].

I was also a lead developer at a startup called Spare Hanger for almost two years. While there, I implemented and designed many features of the website.

I have a degree in Computer Science from Louisiana State University. During my time there, I worked closely with the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][lbrn]. I rebuilt and redesigned their website from scratch.

But most importantly, I have a treasured [collection of personal projects][projects] that I've built over the years.

I love to talk about software, clothing, design, music, and many other things. You can reach me through [Twitter][twitter] or [email][email].

Still reading? A little more [about me][about].
