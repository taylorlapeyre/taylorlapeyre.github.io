I'm a web developer in New Orleans. Right now I go to Louisiana State University.

I'm currently a part-time developer at [Everlane][1], where I am lucky enough to be building one of my favorite clothing brands, and lead developer at [Spare Hanger][0] in Baton Rouge.

I've also been the web developer for the [Louisiana Biomedical Research Network][2] for almost three years. This year I began working on a new [website][3] that will make it easier for people to find a place to live.

I love to talk about software, programming, design, music, and many other things. You can reach me through [Twitter][4] or [email][5].

Still reading? A little more [about me][6].
