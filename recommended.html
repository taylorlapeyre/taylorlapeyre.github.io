  <p>These are some of my favorite things. Hopefully you'll find some use in them as well.</p>

    I've been a steadfast Linux enthusiast for many years, but it was only recently that I decided to give Arch a shot. It truly is the best Linux distrobution for me, stnding up for exectly what I beleive in: simplicity, code-correctness, openness, and freedom. I enjoy having complete control over my system, and Arch linux gives me just that.

    It would a seem a bit odd, I think, for a programmer to not enjoy well-made letterforms. We stare at text all day. Writing, tweaking, deleting, and manipulating text is a large part of what we do. Therefore, I also have a large appreciation for typography and, recently, penmenship. I use this legal pad for ideas, designs, homework, code, practicing my writing, and many other things. It's very much one of my most important tools.

    Jeans are one of the things that I really find really fascinating. Raw denm begins very stiff and uncomfortable and has a very deep (almost black) navy hue when you wear them for the first time. However, as you wear them over time, they loosen up and conform to you as if they were made specifically for you. The dark navy hue gives way to lighter electric blues in the places that receive the most wear. It's truly a transformative process, and the jeans grow with you.

  <h4><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a></h4>

  <p>
    The above things are useful no doubt, but this book is by far the most useful thing on this list. Clean Code taught me to program more precisely, practically, and idiomatially. The rules and ideas laid down in this book are some of the same that I will always adhere to in my own code. Among them, the famous boyscout rule: always leave the codebase in better shape than you found it.

    While these are all my favorite tools, this is by far the most fun. I went to the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts to study Jazz for two years, and this guitar was with me almost every day. This guitar is wonderful for a variety of reasons, but what is important is that a guitar allows me to express myself in a way that a lot of things simply can't. Music is truly one of my most favorite things in the world, and this guitar allows me to play it the way that I want to.
