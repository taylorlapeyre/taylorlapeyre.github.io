My personal projects are the result of years of tinkering and experimentation. Some are constantly changing, while others are on hold or finished. The following projects represent the code that I like to write.

### [OJ](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/oj)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
An easy way to talk to your database in Clojure.
{: refdef}

I built OJ so that I could access my database in a more intuitive way. Existing libraries were complex or did not allow query generation, so I spent a couple weekends thinking up OJ's design. So far, it has proved popular with others as well.

### [A Basic Wardrobe](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/basicwardrobe.info)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
A simple website which lays out a basic wardrobe for men.
{: refdef}

Everyone has encountered a time when they want to start dressing well on a daily basis. After going through this period myself in college, I decided to pass my knowledge to others in the form of this simple website.

### [.files](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/.files)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
My configuration files and a list of tools that I use.
{: refdef}

This project is one of my oldest, spanning from when I first started programming to now. It provides a way to get my computer from a factory state to something that feels personal and productive. My dotfiles have gone through many iterations, but I feel very confident in them.

### [Yelp Rating Predictor](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/yelp-review-sentiment-analyser)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
A project that predicts the rating of a business using sentiment analysis.
{: refdef}

The goal of this project was to, given Yelp's academic dataset of over 16,000 reviews, accurately predict the rating of a business based on the language that reviewers use. I used sentiment analysis and wrote an algorithm that was more accurate than I expected.

### [hn-clojure](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/hn-clojure)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
A basic implementation of Hacker News in Clojure.
{: refdef}

I made this website as a personal experiment to make something marginally useful with Clojure. It helped me learn the ins and outs of web development in the language, and can serve as a useful starting point for others.

### [Lita Plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Ataylorlapeyre+lita)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
A multitude of extensions and plugins for my favorite robot.
{: refdef}

[Lita](https://www.lita.io/) is a robot that lives in Everlane's chatroom. I wrote and open sourced a bunch of plugins for Lita that extend its functionality quite a bit.

### [â€¦Among Many Others](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre)

{:refdef: .subtitle}
All of which can be found on my GitHub profile.
{: refdef}

These were just some of my favorite projects. Many others (including various experiments and websites) can be found on GitHub.
