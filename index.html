  <p>I'm a web developer in New Orleans. Right now I go to Louisiana State University.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a lead developer at Keletaire in Baton Rouge, where I make <a href="http://sparehanger.com">Spare Hanger</a>.</p>
  <p>I've recently begun work at <a href="http://everlane.com/">Everlane</a>, where I hope to help people find clothing that they enjoy.</p>
  <p>As an employed student, I've been the web developer for the <a href="http://lbrn.lsu.edu">Louisiana Biomedical Research Network</a> for almost three years.</p>
  <p>This year I began working on a new web app that will make it easier for people to find a place to live.</p>
  <p>I love to talk about software, programming, design, music, and many other things. Feel free to reach me through <a href="http://twitter.com/taylorlapeyre">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:hello@taylorlapeyre.me">Email</a>.</p>
