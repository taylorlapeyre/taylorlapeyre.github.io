This is my website. It's source code is very simple, because the site is also very simple.

- It uses Jekyll to generate itself.
- It uses the wonderful [Xtreem](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/xtreem/) typeface for the header.
- All content is written in markdown, including my [résumé](/resume.md).
- It is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
