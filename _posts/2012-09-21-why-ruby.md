title: Why Ruby is a Great Language

In my opinion, what makes programming languages so much different from each other is the different ways that they make you think about solving a problem. For instance, when I am programming in Java, I think about solutions in terms of classes, objects, what should go in the main method, etc.

One useful habit that I’ve picked up as I’ve started learning other languages is to code a program in at least one other language before you consider it “completed.” Almost every time I finish programming something, I want to try coding it in Ruby because it’s just a fun language to write in.

When I’m coding in ruby, I find myself getting very close to human speech in my code because of the way that the language is built. Furthermore, (and most importantly) I almost always discover a *better way* of coding the solution in the language I started in.

It’s because of this that I consider Ruby to be such a powerful and great language – not because it has great syntax or is easy to pick up, but because using it fundamentally changes the way I approach a problem in a positive way.
