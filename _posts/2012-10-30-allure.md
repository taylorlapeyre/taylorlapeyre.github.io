For some reason – whether it’s because of some fundamental truth about how people work or even just my personality – I’ve always been very drawn toward the idea of owning and using something for a very long time.

For example, I have a jacket that I’ve owned for about 3 years now which I’ve worn an extraordinary amount of times. The jacket was some kind of military-style jacket that I think my mother bought for me back when I didn’t particularly care for clothes. It isn’t super warm – just made of a single layer of worn-in cotton. But that jacket has progressed through many points in my life with me and has developed some character of its own.

The jacket was only one example, but I own many of these kinds of things. These “tried and true” possessions are the kind of things that we should all aspire to have. They benefit our lives by becoming more and more meaningful as they are used. Additionally, they help eliminate the constant desire for something new. Not a new jacket every winter, not a new laptop whenever we can afford it – but one object that does one thing, and does it damn well. One object that fits you and that you’re comfortable with. One object that grows with you. Those are the kinds of possessions that I aspire to have.
