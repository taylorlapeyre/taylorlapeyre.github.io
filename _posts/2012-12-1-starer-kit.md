One of the defining aspects of programmers is that we love to *tinker*. It's true: while I‘ve managed to learn and make many things, but I've also changed my programming environment many many times looking for one that makes me *happy* to work in it.

This post is mainly aimed at people that love to tinker and try other people‘s “Habitats” in the search for the perfect one.

### Software

Good software is essential to creating good software. As funny as that sounds, it’s also immensely true. Much like how a blacksmith benefits from using the best metal equipment he can get his hands on, a programmer benefits by using the best software they can find.

However, it's not enough to simply *have* the best tools. We must also diligently *use* our tools to the point where they become invisible to us, making the software that you are creating your main focus. Make no mistake, Programming is a craft.

#### Sublime Text
	
If a programmer was compared to a blacksmith, then a *text editor* would be his hammer and anvil. Text editors are, without a doubt, the most important tool that any programmer can use. Everything that we manipulate and create is created and rooted in text. It follows, then, to find and use a great text editor.

[Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com) is the best text editor that I've been able to find. It is fast, it is beautiful, it is functional, and most of all - it doesn't get in the way. It's an editor that has a huge community surrounding it, and it is as stable as anything that I've tried. There are a huge array of packages available for sublime text, and taking advantage of them will benefit you in more ways than one. [Nettuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/) has a great [course](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/) available that shows the ins and outs of this fantastic piece of software.

#### Vim

Ah, Vim.

[Vim](http://vim.org) (in case you don't know) is a very different editor from Sublime Text. Vim is a very old editor, with it's development spanning back to the beginnings of unix. Vim operates by having multiple "modes" that allow the user to do different things. It's a complicated editor with a steep learning curve, but Vim is ubiquitous - and for good reason. If you've ever had the pleasure of seeing a masterful vim user at work, you will be able to appreciate the incredible ways that Vim allows you to manipulate your text.

Much like the way that a novel writer may start to hold his favorite pen dear after writing pages upon pages, old users of Vim love its obscure key-combinations and feel at home in its seemingly complicated ways. If you also get to this point, then you will always have a perfect editing experience at your fingertips, no matter what your environment is. I recommend starting to use it.

#### Git

Source control is extremely important in today's coding world. Not only does it provide a way of backing up your work, but with the addition of source control networks like [Github](http://github.com), it has become an essential way of storing and sharing your code. In my opinion, [git](http://git.org) is the best way of doing that, hands down.

From somebody coming from a "write code, save code, done" workflow, changing to a git-focused workflow can be frustrating or complicated. But in reality, source control is an invaluable tool that you will most likely learn to love with use.
