### A Little More About Me

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I'll try to be concise.

- I write programs in [Ruby][0], [Javascript][js], and [Clojure][clj].
- I have a strong interest in iOS development. I hope to learn more of it soon.
- I'm an advocate for open source software, and I try to contribute where I can.
- I like typography, [clothing][1], and design of all kinds.
- I love [music][3], and I play jazz guitar and banjo.

My [tools][5] are simple, and the [things I've made][6] with them are simple to use.

Looking for something more official? Here's my [résumé][resume]. You can find the source code for this website [here][7].
