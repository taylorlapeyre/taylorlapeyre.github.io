### A Little More About Me

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I will try to be concise.

- I like programming in [Ruby][0], Javascript, and Clojure.
- I specialize in web applications, with an interest in iOS development.
- I am an advocate for open source software.
- I like typography, [clothing][1], and design of all kinds.
- I like flying [kites][2] and model airplanes.
- I love [music][3], and I play jazz guitar and banjo.
- I occasionally write down my [thoughts][4].

I welcome you to check out my [tools][5] and the [things I've made][6] with them.
