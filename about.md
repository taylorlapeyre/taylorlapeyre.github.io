### A Little More About Me

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I'll try to be concise.

- I like programming in [Ruby][0], Javascript, and Clojure.
- I really like the web and making things for it.
- I specialize in web applications, with an interest in iOS development.
- I'm an advocate for open source software, and I try to contribute where I can.
- I like typography, [clothing][1], and design of all kinds.
- I love [music][3], and I play jazz guitar and banjo.

Check out my [tools][5] and some of the [things I've made][6] with them. Looking for something more official? Here's my [résumé][resume].

I use a macbook, and my editor is [Atom][9]. You can find the source code for this website [here][7].
