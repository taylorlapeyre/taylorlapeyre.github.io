### A Little More About Me ###

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I will try to be concise.

* I like programming in [Ruby][1], Python, and Clojure.
* I like designing [web applications][2], especially with Rails.
* I like typography and design.
* I like [music][3] and playing guitar, especially Jazz guitar.
* I like learning new things and becoming an expert at a craft.

I do all my development on a Macbook Pro and an old Dell laptop running Arch Linux.

You can find the source code for this website [here][6].
