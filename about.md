I’m a web developer and designer from New Orleans, LA. I enjoy making websites and applications that make people’s lives easier and simpler.

I’m also a student at Louisiana State University and a unix and typography enthusiast.

If you would like to contact me, send me an email or shout at me on twitter.

### Colophon

This website uses [typekit](https://typekit.com/) for its typography,  [symbolset](https://symbolset.com/) for its icons, and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate itself.

I made this website using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) on a Macbook Pro, and I use [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) to write blog posts.
