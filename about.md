### A Little More About Me ###

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I will try to be concise.

* I like programming in [Ruby][1], Javascript, and Clojure.
* I specialize in web applications, although I'm learning iOS development as well.
* I like typography, design of all kinds, and [clothing][2].
* I like [music][3] and play jazz guitar and banjo.
* I like using unix-based systems and am an advocate for open source software.
* I believe that simplicity is always better than compexity.

I welcome you to check out my [tools][4] and the [things I've made][5] with them.

### Colophon ###

I develop on a Macbook Pro. I also have an old Dell laptop that I use for Linux experiments.

You can find the source code for this website [here][6].
