### A Little More About Me ###

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I will try to be concise.

* I like programming in [Ruby][1], Javascript, and Clojure.
* I specialize in web applications, with an interest in iOS development.
* I am an advocate for open source software.
* I like typography, [clothing][2], and design of all kinds.
* I like flying [kites](http://instagram.com/p/irgE96oFcg/) and model airplanes.
* I love [music][3], and I play jazz guitar and banjo.
* I believe that simplicity is always better than compexity.

I welcome you to check out my [tools][4] and the [things I've made][5] with them.

### Colophon ###

I develop on a Macbook Pro. I also have an old Dell laptop that I use for Linux experiments.
