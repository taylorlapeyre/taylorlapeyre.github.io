### A Little More About Me ###

Reading walls of text on the internet is a pain, so I will try to be concise.

* I like programming in [Ruby][1], Python, and Clojure.
* I like designing web applications.
* I like typography and design.
* I like [music][3] and playing instruments, especially jazz guitar.
* I like using Unix systems and am an advocate for open source software.
* I believe that simplicity is always better than compexity.

I welcome you to check out my [toolbox][4] and the [things I've made][5] with it.

### Colophon ###

I develop software on an old Dell laptop running Arch Linux, although I use a Macbook Pro for everyday computing.

You can find the source code for this website [here][6].
